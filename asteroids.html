        Instructions on how to play:<br>
        "w" for moving forward, "r" for rotating and "space" for shooting<br>
        30 seconds later the game would switch to the difficult mode and there will be an asteroid defender. If it hits
        your ship, your ship would be destroyed and the game ends.<br>
        The defender is unbeatable and it will try to generate a fence to destroy your ship. Be careful! See the
        features below the canvas!

        At the begining of each game, the player would have 3 lives and 0 score. The ship's movement is depending on the
        thrust, so even if the player didn't do
        anything, it will still move towards the direction of the head of the ship at a really low speed. Crashing by
        asteroids or the bullets from the enemy will
        only cost 1 life of the ship, but colliding with the asteroids' defender (i.e the red enemy ship) will end the
        game immediately.<br>
        The game has 2 levels, and there's no winning condition. The only goal for the palyer is to gain more scores and
        survive longer. So after the player's ship has
        survived 30 seconds, an enemy ship would appear and swith the game to the hard level. The enemy ship would
        generate a red fence (i.e the red line on the canvas)
        that can cost a life of the player's ship. Trying to shoot the enemy is useless as it is unbeatable therefore
        the player has to hide from the enemy and its fence.<br>
        About how to gain marks: Hitting the light yellow asteroids would not destroy them for good, but the player can
        still gain 15 marks for each success. After the
        larger asteroids were destroyed, it will split into 2 and the smaller ones would be faster and harder to aim. A
        success in destroying the smaller ones wil give
        the player 30 marks as it is much harder than destroying the big ones. Only destroying asteroids can increase
        the player's score.
